data/ contains original data set, as well as some file generated during data pre-processing.
In data/original/, train-full.tsv is used as the train set and test_13.tsv is used as the validation set in accordance with the settings in paper (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.704.5740&rep=rep1&type=pdf). 

scripts/ contains scripts for preprocessing data, training CNN and testing CNN.
For training the model with preprocessing steps, go into folder scripts/ and type following command:
	python train.py <raw_train_file> <raw_val_file> <vec-to-use>
	e.g.:
	python train.py ../data/original/train_full.tsv ../data/original/test_13.tsv glove
For testing the model, go into folder scripts/ and type following command:
	python test.py <raw_test_file> <model_file> <scoring script>
	e.g.:
	python test.py ../data/test_merged.tsv ../model/model-glove.h5 ./score-semeval2014-task9-subtaskB.pl

model/ contains best CNN model that is trained so far.
